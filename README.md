# Summary

I wanted to re-create one of my project, which is the Calculator App but without using eval(). As i did some research on eval() method, it is considered unsafe. Although, using this method makes this type of project a bit easier and the process smooth. Therefore, the challenges that i faced building this App made me questioned what i've learned so far about JavaScript but kept going. Thus, these challenges shift my thinking on solving and debugging my code and of course how to understand JavaScript. Worth it!
